# PROJECT NAME HERE

### GROUP NAME HERE

Sophia Dasser and Niki Chen

### Project Description:

This project is a chat that allows multiple clients to interact with each other through a single server. Some key features this chat has is that each client is able to create a username and when a message is sent, all clients will recieve the message along with the messaging client's username and the time stamp of the message. Clients can connect and disconnect to the chat at any time and join the conversation. Another key feature our chat has is a chat log, which is a txt file created by the server that includes the entire chat as well as which clients have disconnected/connected.
### Instructions:

How does the user install/compile/run the program.
To compile the program please run:
make compile

To run the program please open multiple terminal windows:
1. Create one server using ./server
2. Create up to 5 clients (that is simply our max but that constant can change if needed) using ./client
   
How does the user interact with this program?
The user is first prompted to create a username and then can send messages to any of the other connected clients/server.
